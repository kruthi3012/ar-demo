# ar-demo
Here's a simple AR app that got me started with Unity along with Vuforia.
This was built as part of the Newolf AR techcluster individual project.


The app recognises 2 image targets and augments an audio and a video on tracking. Please find the image targets in the drive folder.
The .apk file is available in the drive link below.
